A slide-able, play-able cartogram showing same-sex marriage laws in the states from 1995 to 2015.

Uses the awesome [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) for UI, data management, templating, etc. Cartogram lazily generated using [Andrew McGill](https://github.com/arm5077)'s handy [squared-maps library](https://github.com/arm5077/squared-maps).

Data [from Pew](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/26/same-sex-marriage-state-by-state/).
